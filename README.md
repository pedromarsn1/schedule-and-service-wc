# Scheduling And Building A Service
Working alongside Hitallo Cavalcanti, we built a service that conects to a Database and send infos about the product straight to the API

## Resume
It conects to a Database, the one i used here was a PostgreSQL source, then i built classes to send all the data to Woocommerce API.
After that, i schedule de update of the product to be done in a interspace of 5 minutes.
